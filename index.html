<p>Hi, I'm Laura. I founded Lollypop Lawns because I love being outdoors and making outdoor spaces beautiful. My promise is to serve you with professional communication and timeliness.</p>
<p>I've been doing yard maintenance for family and friends for several years. My dad passed down his wisdom as a landscape architect and my mom shared her passion as a green thumb gardener.</p>
